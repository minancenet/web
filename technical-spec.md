## General

### Overview

The Minance trading system is a peer-peer system in which players of the game Skyblock by Hypixel are able to execute trades for Minance site users on the game's internal bazaar. Thus allowing players to place buy or sell orders externally, via any device with access to the internet. With our competitive system and a large enough ratio of order placers to orderers, orders should be executed on a close to in-game order time scale.

### Context

The bazaar on Skyblock has always been a much undervalued part of Skyblock's value, although, the bazaar brings much more to the game than most realize. With Hypixel's millions of users the bazaar is an optimal environment for users who want to experiment with markets without any barrier to entry. The Hypixel Bazaar is different than most simulated markets as well due to the larger portion of the player base actually playing the RPG/ MMO game within Skyblock.

Allowing users to place orders externally would only improve upon the current bazaar community along with hopefully boosting the volume of the bazaar allowing for the bazaar trading experience to become more immersed.

### Goals

- Website for users to place orders externally on the Skyblock bazaar.
- Website to allow users to fill orders in game for website order placers.
- Functional botnet for storing items, and accepting trading with users who place orders.

### Non-Goals

- Minance is not an automatic, external order place. Orders are executed by other human players.
- Minance does not give any users advantages or insights within the Skyblock economy.
